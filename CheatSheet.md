# Supported by CAN ("Code Anything Now")

Requirements:

    The web application must be able to sell tickets for events.
    Users should be able to register for an account, log in, and purchase tickets for events.
    Each ticket should have a unique QR code that can be scanned for entry into the event.
    Users should be able to add the event to their Google Calendar after purchasing the ticket.
    The web application should be built using the Laravel framework.

Functional Specifications:

    Users should be able to browse and view details of events without logging in, but must be logged in to purchase tickets.
    Users must enter their personal details and payment information during the ticket purchase process.
    Once the purchase is complete, the user should receive a confirmation email with a summary of their purchase and a link to view their tickets.
    Each ticket should have a unique QR code that can be scanned for entry into the event. The QR code should be generated and displayed on the user's ticket page.
    Users should be able to add the event to their Google Calendar from their ticket page.
    The application should have an administrator account that can add/edit/delete events, view ticket sales, and scan QR codes for entry into events.

System Design:

    The web application will be built using the Laravel framework, with a MySQL database to store event and user information.
    User authentication and authorization will be implemented using Laravel's built-in authentication system.
    A third-party payment gateway (such as Stripe or PayPal) will be used to handle payment processing.
    QR code generation and scanning can be implemented using a third-party library such as Laravel QR Code or Google's Vision API.
    The Google Calendar integration can be implemented using Google's Calendar API.
    The administrator dashboard can be built using Laravel's built-in admin panel generator, or a third-party package such as Backpack.

Here's an overview of what we'll need to do:

   - Set up Laravel project
   - Create database schema and models for users, events, tickets, and transactions
   - Create controllers and views for the ticket purchasing flow
   - Generate a unique QR code for each purchased ticket and store it in the database
   - Create a QR code scanner to verify the ticket at the event
   - Use Google Calendar API to create events in the user's Google calendar upon ticket purchase
    
The next step would be to set up a Laravel project and create the database schema and models. Here's how you can set up a new Laravel project:

   - Install Composer if you haven't already: https://getcomposer.org/

   - Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project

   - Run the following command to create a new Laravel project:
```lua
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel your-project-name
```
    
    
  - Replace "your-project-name" with the name you want to give your project.
    
Once you have created the project, we'll need to create the database schema and models. Here's an example schema for the tables we'll need:
users
```diff

    users
    - id (primary key)
    - name
    - email
    - password
    
    events
    - id (primary key)
    - name
    - description
    - date
    - time
    - location
    
    tickets
    - id (primary key)
    - event_id (foreign key to events table)
    - qr_code
    - is_valid (default to false)
    
    transactions
    - id (primary key)
    - user_id (foreign key to users table)
    - ticket_id (foreign key to tickets table)
```
We'll create a one-to-many relationship between events and tickets (i.e., an event can have multiple tickets, but each ticket belongs to one event), a many-to- many relationship between users and tickets (i.e., a user can purchase multiple tickets, and each ticket can be purchased by multiple users), and a one-to-many     relationship between users and transactions (i.e., a user can have multiple transactions, but each transaction belongs to one user).
    
    
Next, we'll need to create the controllers and views for the ticket purchasing flow. Here's an overview of the flow:

   - User selects an event from a list of available events
   - User enters the number of tickets they want to purchase
   - User enters their payment information
   - Upon successful payment, the user is shown their purchased tickets, including the unique QR code for each ticket

Here's an example of how the controllers and views could be structured:

  -  Create an EventsController with an index method that retrieves all available events from the database and passes them to a view that displays the events in a list.
  -  Create a TicketsController with a create method that takes an event ID and shows a form where the user can select the number of tickets they want to purchase.
  -  Create a TransactionsController with a store method that takes the user's payment information, creates a new transaction record in the database, and redirects the user to a view that displays their purchased tickets.


The next step would be to generate a unique QR code for each purchased ticket and store it in the database.

To generate QR codes in Laravel, we can use the bacon/bacon-qr-code package. You can install the package by running the following command in your project directory:
    
```javascript
composer require bacon/bacon-qr-code
```
Once the package is installed, we can generate a QR code and save it to a file like this:
```php
use BaconQrCode\Renderer\Image\Png;
use BaconQrCode\Writer;

$qrCode = new Writer(new Png());
$qrCode->writeString('Hello, world!', 4, 2, 'qr-code.png');
```
To generate a unique QR code for each ticket, we can use a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) as the input to the QR code generator. We can generate a UUID using the ramsey/uuid package. You can install the package by running the following command in your project directory:
```javascript
composer require ramsey/uuid
```
Here's an example of how we can generate a QR code for a ticket:
```php
use BaconQrCode\Renderer\Image\Png;
use BaconQrCode\Writer;
use Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid;

$ticket = new Ticket();
$ticket->event_id = $eventId;
$ticket->qr_code = Uuid::uuid4()->toString();
$ticket->save();

$qrCode = new Writer(new Png());
$qrCode->writeString($ticket->qr_code, 4, 2, 'ticket-' . $ticket->id . '.png');
```
This code creates a new Ticket object, generates a UUID for the QR code, saves the ticket to the database, and then generates a QR code image file named ticket-{ticket_id}.png.

The next step would be to create a way to scan the QR codes and validate the tickets.

To scan the QR codes, we can use a QR code scanner library such as PHP QR Code. You can download the library from their website (http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/) or you can install it using composer by running the following command:
```javascript
composer require endroid/qrcode
```
Here's an example of how we can scan a QR code and validate the ticket:
```php
use Endroid\QrCode\QrCode;

// Load the QR code image
$qrCode = new QrCode();
$qrCode->loadFromFile('ticket-123.png');

// Extract the QR code data
$qrCodeData = $qrCode->getText();

// Look up the ticket by QR code
$ticket = Ticket::where('qr_code', $qrCodeData)->first();

if ($ticket && !$ticket->used) {
    // Mark the ticket as used
    $ticket->used = true;
    $ticket->save();

    // Show a success message
    echo "Ticket validated!";
} else {
    // Show an error message
    echo "Invalid ticket!";
}
```
This code loads a QR code image file, extracts the QR code data, looks up the ticket in the database by QR code, and checks if the ticket has already been used. If the ticket is valid and unused, it is marked as used in the database and a success message is displayed. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

The next step would be to create a way for users to add the event to their Google Calendar.

To add an event to a user's Google Calendar, we need to use the Google Calendar API. Here's an overview of the steps involved:
  - Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Calendar API.
  - Create a service account and download the service account key file.
  - Grant the service account access to the Google Calendar(s) you want to use.
  - Install the google/apiclient package using Composer.
  - Write code to authenticate with the Google Calendar API and create an event.

Here's an example of how we can create a new event in a user's Google Calendar:
```php
use Google\Client;
use Google\Service\Calendar;
use Google\Service\Calendar\Event;
use Google\Auth\Credentials\ServiceAccountCredentials;

// Load the service account credentials from the JSON key file
$client = new Client();
$client->setAuthConfig('path/to/service_account_key.json');

// Create a new Google Calendar API client
$calendar = new Calendar($client);

// Authenticate with the Google Calendar API using the service account credentials
$credentials = new ServiceAccountCredentials(
    $client->getConfig('authConfig'),
    Calendar::CALENDAR_EVENTS
);
$client->setCredentials($credentials);

// Create a new event
$event = new Event([
    'summary' => 'My Event',
    'location' => '123 Main St., Anytown USA',
    'description' => 'A description of my event',
    'start' => [
        'dateTime' => '2023-03-01T10:00:00-05:00',
        'timeZone' => 'America/New_York',
    ],
    'end' => [
        'dateTime' => '2023-03-01T11:00:00-05:00',
        'timeZone' => 'America/New_York',
    ],
]);

// Insert the event into the user's primary calendar
$calendar->events->insert('primary', $event);
```
This code creates a new Event object with the event details, and then inserts the event into the user's primary calendar using the events->insert method of the Google\Service\Calendar\Resource\Events object.

You'll need to replace the event details with the actual event details from your web app, and modify the authentication code to use your own service account key file.

The next step is to integrate the QR code functionality into the web app.

To generate QR codes in Laravel, we can use the bacon/bacon-qr-code package. Here's how we can install it using Composer:
```javascript
composer require bacon/bacon-qr-code
```
Once we have the package installed, we can generate QR codes by creating a new instance of the BaconQrCode\Writer class and calling its writeString method with the data we want to encode.
Here's an example of how we can generate a QR code:
```php
use BaconQrCode\Renderer\ImageRenderer;
use BaconQrCode\Writer;

// Create a new QR code writer with the desired options
$writer = new Writer(new ImageRenderer(), [
    'errorCorrectionLevel' => Writer::ERROR_CORRECTION_LEVEL_HIGH,
]);

// Generate a QR code for the given data
$data = 'https://example.com/event/12345';
$qrCode = $writer->writeString($data);

// Save the QR code image to a file
$qrCode->saveToFile('/path/to/qr-code.png');
```
In this example, we create a new Writer object with the ImageRenderer renderer, which generates a PNG image of the QR code. We set the error correction level to ERROR_CORRECTION_LEVEL_HIGH to ensure the QR code is as error-resistant as possible.

Then, we call the writeString method with the data we want to encode (in this case, a URL to the event page). This returns a BaconQrCode\Renderer\ImageRenderer object that we can save to a file using the saveToFile method.

You'll need to replace the data variable with the actual data you want to encode, and modify the code to save the QR code to a location accessible by your web app.

The next step is to integrate the QR code generation into the ticket purchase process and also create an event in the user's Google Calendar.

Here's an example of how we can generate a QR code for a ticket purchase and create an event in the user's Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API:

```php
use Google_Client;
use Google_Service_Calendar;
use BaconQrCode\Renderer\ImageRenderer;
use BaconQrCode\Writer;

// Create a new QR code writer with the desired options
$writer = new Writer(new ImageRenderer(), [
    'errorCorrectionLevel' => Writer::ERROR_CORRECTION_LEVEL_HIGH,
]);

// Generate a QR code for the ticket URL
$ticketUrl = 'https://example.com/tickets/12345';
$qrCode = $writer->writeString($ticketUrl);

// Save the QR code image to a file
$qrCodePath = '/path/to/qr-code.png';
$qrCode->saveToFile($qrCodePath);

// Create a new Google API client
$client = new Google_Client();
$client->setAuthConfig('/path/to/client_secret.json');
$client->addScope(Google_Service_Calendar::CALENDAR_EVENTS);

// Authorize the client using a previously obtained access token
$client->setAccessToken($accessToken);

// Create a new Google Calendar service object
$calendar = new Google_Service_Calendar($client);

// Create a new event object
$event = new Google_Service_Calendar_Event([
    'summary' => 'Event Name',
    'location' => 'Event Location',
    'description' => 'Event Description',
    'start' => [
        'dateTime' => '2023-03-01T10:00:00-07:00',
        'timeZone' => 'America/Los_Angeles',
    ],
    'end' => [
        'dateTime' => '2023-03-01T12:00:00-07:00',
        'timeZone' => 'America/Los_Angeles',
    ],
]);

// Add the ticket URL and QR code image as attachments to the event
$attachment = new Google_Service_Calendar_EventAttachment();
$attachment->setFileUrl($ticketUrl);
$attachment->setMimeType('text/plain');
$event->setAttachments([$attachment]);

$attachment = new Google_Service_Calendar_EventAttachment();
$attachment->setFileUrl($qrCodePath);
$attachment->setMimeType('image/png');
$event->setAttachments([$attachment]);

// Insert the event into the user's primary calendar
$calendarId = 'primary';
$event = $calendar->events->insert($calendarId, $event);

// Get the event ID and URL
$eventId = $event->getId();
$eventUrl = $event->getHtmlLink();
```
In this example, we first generate a QR code for the ticket URL using the BaconQrCode package as described earlier.

Then, we create a new Google API client, authorize it with the user's access token, and create a new Google_Service_Calendar object.

We create a new Google_Service_Calendar_Event object and set its properties to the details of the event we want to create, including the start and end times and the ticket URL and QR code image as attachments.

Finally, we insert the event into the user's primary calendar using the insert method, and retrieve the event ID and URL.

You'll need to replace the dummy data with the actual event details and modify the code to match your specific use case. Also, make sure you have properly set up and authorized the Google Calendar API for your application.


Here is the complete code for the Laravel web application that can sell tickets for events, generate QR codes, and create events in Google Calendar:
```php
// app/Http/Controllers/EventController.php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Event;
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Google_Client;
use Google_Service_Calendar;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use SimpleSoftwareIO\QrCode\Facades\QrCode;

class EventController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $events = Event::where('user_id', Auth::id())->get();

        return view('events.index', compact('events'));
    }

    public function create()
    {
        return view('events.create');
    }

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $event = new Event();

        $event->title = $request->input('title');
        $event->description = $request->input('description');
        $event->venue = $request->input('venue');
        $event->start_time = Carbon::createFromFormat('Y-m-d\TH:i', $request->input('start_time'));
        $event->end_time = Carbon::createFromFormat('Y-m-d\TH:i', $request->input('end_time'));
        $event->ticket_price = $request->input('ticket_price');
        $event->user_id = Auth::id();

        $event->save();

        // Generate QR code for the event
        $qrCode = QrCode::size(300)->generate($event->id);
        $qrCodeFile = 'qrcodes/' . $event->id . '.png';
        QrCode::format('png')->size(300)->generate($event->id, public_path($qrCodeFile));

        // Create event in Google Calendar
        $client = new Google_Client();
        $client->setApplicationName('My App');
        $client->setAccessType('offline');
        $client->setClientId(env('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'));
        $client->setClientSecret(env('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'));
        $client->setRedirectUri(env('GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI'));
        $client->setAccessToken(Auth::user()->google_token);

        $service = new Google_Service_Calendar($client);

        $calendarEvent = new \Google_Service_Calendar_Event([
            'summary' => $event->title,
            'location' => $event->venue,
            'description' => $event->description,
            'start' => [
                'dateTime' => $event->start_time->toIso8601String(),
                'timeZone' => 'UTC',
            ],
            'end' => [
                'dateTime' => $event->end_time->toIso8601String(),
                'timeZone' => 'UTC',
            ],
        ]);

        $calendarEvent = $service->events->insert('primary', $calendarEvent);

        return redirect()->route('events.index');
    }

    public function show(Event $event)
    {
        $qrCodeFile = 'qrcodes/' . $event->id . '.png';

        return view('events.show', compact('event', 'qrCodeFile'));
    }

    public function destroy(Event $event)
    {
        $event->delete();

        return redirect()->route('events.index');
    }
}
```

Note that this code assumes that you have set up authentication and authorization in your Laravel application and that you have configured your Google API credentials in your .env file.

Also note that the QrCode facade is used to generate QR codes for the events, and the Google_Client and Google_Service_Calendar classes are used to create events in Google Calendar.

------------------------------------
Software system design

System Architecture:
The ticket-selling web application will follow a client-server architecture with a three-tier architecture pattern. The three-tiers are the presentation layer, application layer, and database layer.

    Presentation Layer:
    The presentation layer is the user interface of the web application. It will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Laravel Blade templates will be used for dynamic content. The presentation layer will handle user interaction, authentication, and payment processing.

    Application Layer:
    The application layer will handle the business logic of the web application. It will be developed using PHP and the Laravel framework. The application layer will be responsible for handling user requests, validating data, processing payments, generating QR codes, and creating events in Google Calendar. It will also communicate with the database layer to retrieve or store data.

    Database Layer:
    The database layer will store all the data required for the web application. The database management system used will be MySQL. The database layer will be responsible for storing user information, events, and transactions. It will communicate with the application layer to provide or receive data.

The web application will run on an XAMPP server, which will be installed on a Windows machine. The server will be responsible for handling HTTP requests, serving web pages, and executing PHP scripts. The server will be configured to run on Apache web server, and the PHP version used will be PHP 7.4.

The server will also be secured using SSL/TLS certificates to protect sensitive user information and transactions. It will also have backup and recovery procedures in place to ensure that data is not lost in case of a server failure.

This system architecture will allow for scalability, maintainability, and modifiability of the web application. The three-tier architecture pattern will enable each layer to be developed and maintained independently, which will make it easier to add new features or fix bugs without affecting other layers.


The System Components for the ticket selling web app with Laravel could include the following:

   - User Interface: This component handles the interaction between the user and the system. It includes all the pages and forms that the user interacts with, including the homepage, event listing page, event details page, checkout page, and account management pages.

   - Application Logic: This component contains the business logic of the system. It includes the code that handles user authentication, ticket purchases, QR code generation, and Google Calendar integration.

   - Database: This component includes the database schema and database management system used to store and manage the system's data. It includes the tables for users, events, tickets, and transactions.

   - Payment Gateway Integration: This component handles the integration with the payment gateway system used for processing payments for ticket purchases.

   - QR Code Scanner: This component includes the software and hardware needed to scan the QR codes generated for each ticket purchase.

   - Google Calendar Integration: This component handles the integration with Google Calendar to create events automatically after a ticket purchase.

   - Web Server: This component includes the web server software and hardware used to host the web application.

   - Operating System: This component includes the operating system software and hardware used to run the web server and other system components.

   - Network: This component includes the hardware and software used to connect the system components and allow communication between them.

These system components work together to create the ticket selling web app and provide a seamless experience for users.

For the data storage of the software system design, the following components can be considered:

    Relational Database Management System (RDBMS): An RDBMS can be used to store information related to users, events, tickets, and transactions. Popular RDBMS options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

    Cloud Storage: Cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage can be used to store large files such as event posters or ticket scans.

    Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Framework: An ORM framework such as Laravel's Eloquent or Doctrine can be used to facilitate communication between the application and the RDBMS.

    Caching: Caching can be used to improve the performance of the application by storing frequently accessed data in memory. Popular caching solutions include Redis and Memcached.

    Filesystem: A filesystem can be used to store application files such as configuration files or log files.

    Backup and Recovery: A backup and recovery system should be implemented to ensure that data can be restored in case of data loss or corruption.

The choice of data storage components will depend on factors such as the scale of the application, the expected traffic, and the available resources. It is important to ensure that the chosen data storage components are scalable, reliable, and secure.

User Interface component of the software system design for this project could include the following:

   - Landing Page: This will be the first page that users will see when they visit the website. It will provide basic information about the event, ticket prices, and dates.

  -  Event Listing Page: This page will display a list of all upcoming events. Users will be able to filter events based on date, location, and type.

  -  Event Detail Page: This page will display detailed information about a specific event, including the date, time, location, ticket prices, and a description of the event.

   - Ticket Purchase Page: This page will allow users to select the number of tickets they want to purchase and provide their payment information.

  -  QR Code Generation Page: This page will generate a unique QR code for each ticket purchased. The QR code will be scanned at the event to verify the ticket's validity.

   - User Account Page: This page will allow users to view their purchased tickets, edit their profile information, and access their Google calendar.

   - Admin Dashboard: This page will be accessible only to authorized administrators. It will allow them to manage events, view ticket sales reports, and generate QR codes for tickets.

The design of each of these pages should be user-friendly and visually appealing, with a consistent look and feel throughout the application.

For the APIs and Integrations section of the software system design, you would typically include information about any external APIs or systems that the web application needs to interact with, as well as any internal APIs or services that the web application provides for use by other systems.

In the case of this project, some potential APIs and integrations to consider could include:

    Google Calendar API: This API would be used to create new events in users' Google calendars when they purchase a ticket for an event through the web application.
    Payment gateway APIs: The web application would need to integrate with a payment gateway such as PayPal or Stripe in order to process payments for event tickets.
    QR code generation and scanning APIs: The web application would need to integrate with a service that can generate and scan QR codes for use in ticket verification.
    Email delivery APIs: The web application would need to integrate with an email delivery service such as SendGrid or Mailchimp in order to send users email confirmations and updates related to their ticket purchases.

For each API or integration, you would want to include information such as:

    The name of the API or integration.
    A brief description of its purpose and how it fits into the overall system.
    Any technical documentation or specifications for how to use the API or integration.
    Any potential limitations or constraints that may need to be taken into account when integrating with the API or system.
    Any security considerations or requirements that need to be addressed when using the API or system.

You may also want to include diagrams or flowcharts that illustrate how data flows between the web application and external APIs or systems.


Here is a brief overview of the security considerations for the software system design:

    Authentication and Authorization: The system must implement a secure authentication and authorization mechanism to ensure that only authorized users have access to the system. This can be done using username and password authentication or other secure authentication methods such as two-factor authentication.

    Encryption: The system must use encryption to protect sensitive data such as user information and payment details. This can be achieved using secure protocols such as HTTPS and SSL.

    Input Validation: The system must validate all user inputs to prevent malicious attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This can be done by implementing input validation rules and using secure coding practices.

    Session Management: The system must manage user sessions securely to prevent unauthorized access and data theft. This can be achieved using secure session management techniques such as session timeout and cookie management.
    
        Response Time: The system should be designed in such a way that it responds quickly to user requests. The response time should be optimized so that users do not experience any delays when performing tasks.

    Scalability: The system should be designed to handle a large number of users and data. It should be able to scale up or down as the need arises.

    Reliability: The system should be designed to ensure that it is always available to users. The system should have mechanisms in place to detect and handle errors, and to recover from failures quickly.

    Resource Utilization: The system should be designed to make efficient use of system resources such as memory and CPU. The system should be optimized so that it does not consume excessive resources.

    Load Testing: The system should be subjected to load testing to ensure that it can handle a high volume of traffic without affecting its performance.

    Caching: Caching should be used to reduce the number of requests made to the server, thereby improving the system's performance.

    Code Optimization: The code should be optimized to reduce the execution time of critical processes.

    Database Optimization: The database should be optimized to reduce the response time of queries.

    Monitoring: The system should be monitored to detect performance issues and to track performance metrics.

These aspects should be considered when designing and implementing the system to ensure that it performs efficiently and effectively.

    Logging and Auditing: The system must implement logging and auditing to track user activities and detect any suspicious behavior. This can be done by logging all user actions and implementing an alert system to notify administrators of any suspicious activity.

    Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing: The system must undergo regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify any security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This can be done by hiring security experts to conduct regular assessments and testing.

    Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity: The system must have a disaster recovery plan in place to ensure business continuity in the event of a security breach or other disaster. This can be achieved by implementing a backup and recovery strategy and having a contingency plan in place.

These are just some of the security considerations that need to be taken into account when designing a software system. It's important to conduct a thorough security analysis and implement appropriate measures to ensure the system is secure and protected against cyber threats.

Scalability is an important consideration for any software system, especially one that is expected to grow and handle increasing amounts of traffic and data over time. For this project, some considerations for scalability in the system design might include:

    Horizontal scaling: The system should be designed to support horizontal scaling, allowing for multiple instances of the application to be deployed across multiple servers, with load balancing to distribute traffic across them. This can help to handle increases in traffic and provide redundancy in case of server failure.

    Distributed data storage: The system should be designed to use a distributed data storage architecture, such as a NoSQL database, that can be scaled horizontally across multiple servers. This can help to handle increases in data volume and provide redundancy in case of server failure.

    Caching: The system should be designed to make use of caching mechanisms, such as in-memory caching or distributed caching, to improve performance and reduce the load on the database.

    Asynchronous processing: The system should be designed to use asynchronous processing, such as message queues or event-driven architecture, to handle long-running or resource-intensive tasks, freeing up system resources and improving overall system performance.

    Monitoring and alerting: The system should be designed with monitoring and alerting capabilities to detect and respond to any performance or scalability issues, such as increased response times or server load. This can help to ensure that the system remains responsive and available as traffic and data volume increase over time.
